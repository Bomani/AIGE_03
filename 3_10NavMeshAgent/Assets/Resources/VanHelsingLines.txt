The only way to kill them is to kill you.
Werewolf!
Now, whatever you do, don't stare at him.
Who's hunting whom?
Sounds like I have nothing to worry about.
Next time, stay close, you're no good to me dead.
This is where I come in!
Young man, there's no need to feel down.
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground.
I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy.
Young man, there's a place you can go.
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough.
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time.
They have everything for you men to enjoy,
You can hang out with all the boys ...
Young man, are you listening to me?
I said, young man, what do you want to be?
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams.
But you got to know this one thing!
Young man, I was once in your shoes.
I said, I was down and out with the blues.
I felt no man cared if I were alive.
I felt the whole world was so jive ...
